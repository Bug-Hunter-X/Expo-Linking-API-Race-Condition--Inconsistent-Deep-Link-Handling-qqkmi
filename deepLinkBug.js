This error occurs when using the Expo `Linking` API to handle deep links. The issue stems from a race condition where the app attempts to open a URL before the `Linking.addEventListener` has fully registered.  This results in the URL not being handled correctly or triggering unexpected behavior. The problem often manifests as seemingly random failures to open external URLs or handle specific deep links, especially when the app is launched from a cold start or when background processes are involved.
